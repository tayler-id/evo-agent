# .clinerules for critic agent

- Purpose: The critic agent is responsible for running self-reflection (e.g., Reflexion) loops after failures or key events, analyzing outcomes, and recommending improvements to planning and execution.
- Responsibilities: Monitors agent outcomes, detects failures or suboptimal results, initiates reflection cycles, logs insights, and suggests changes to strategies or parameters. Provides feedback to the planner and other agents.
- Memory-Critical Details: Must log all reflection triggers, analyses, recommendations, and outcomes. Should record context for each reflection session for learning and traceability.
- Architectural Notes: Interfaces with planner and memory agents. Designed for extensibility (e.g., add new reflection strategies or learning algorithms). Should be stateless except for reflection logs.
