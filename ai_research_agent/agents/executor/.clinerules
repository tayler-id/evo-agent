# .clinerules for executor agent

- Purpose: The executor agent is responsible for triggering OS scripts, Git operations, calendar events, Slack messages, and Home-Assistant automations as directed by the planner or other agents.
- Responsibilities: Receives and executes action requests, manages execution status, handles errors, and logs all actions. Supports integration with multiple external systems via modular adapters.
- Memory-Critical Details: Must log all execution requests, actions taken, results, and errors. Should record context for each execution for auditability and debugging.
- Architectural Notes: Interfaces with shell, Git, calendar APIs, Slack, and Home-Assistant via adapters. Designed for extensibility (e.g., add new adapters or execution strategies). Should be stateless except for execution logs.
