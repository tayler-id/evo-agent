# Product Context: AI Research Agent

## Problem Solved

Modern knowledge workers, researchers, and developers are overwhelmed by fragmented, underutilized personal data (“dark data”). Critical insights, code, contacts, and next actions are often lost or inaccessible at the moment of need. This project aims to close that gap by continuously capturing, organizing, and surfacing actionable knowledge—turning passive data into timely, context-aware recommendations and automations.

## How It Should Work (User Experience)

- **Seamless Capture:** Everything the user reads, asks, builds, or says is automatically captured and embedded into a unified knowledge base.
- **Contextual Recall:** At any moment (e.g., via `/recall <topic>`), the system surfaces the most relevant notes, code, or contacts in under a second.
- **Proactive Assistance:** The agent monitors context (e.g., Git branches, calendar, weather, onboarding tasks) and pings the user with the next best action when idle or at key moments.
- **Digest & Summarize:** Users receive daily digests of top research, calendar conflicts, and actionable insights.
- **Voice-to-Note:** Users can quickly drop voice memos, which are transcribed, tagged, and stored for future recall.

## Target User

- AI Researchers
- Knowledge Workers
- Developers and Engineers
- Productivity-focused individuals seeking to maximize the value of their digital footprint

## Core Value Proposition

A modular, AI-powered system that transforms fragmented personal data into actionable, context-aware knowledge—boosting decision quality, productivity, and peace of mind.
