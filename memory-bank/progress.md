# Progress: AI Research Agent (as of 2025-04-25 13:30)

## Project Pivot

- The project has transitioned from a single-class, experiment-logging agent to a modular, multi-agent knowledge management system.
- Framework Decision: Evaluated Letta and ADK, selecting Letta Platform as the core framework.
- Memory Bank documentation (`techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`) updated to reflect the adoption of Letta.

## What Was Accomplished (Previous Phase)

- Implemented a basic AIResearchAgent class with OpenAI integration, SQLite persistence, logging, and basic analysis/visualization.
- Demonstrated experiment logging, evaluation, and analysis in example.py.
- Established a foundation for extensibility and modularity.

## New Roadmap (as of Pivot)

### v0.1 Minimal Feature Set (Highest Priority)

1. **Daily Digest:** Auto-summarize top 5 UX/AI/gardening papers; pull household calendar & weather conflicts.
2. **Quick-Recall:** `/recall <topic>` returns the three most relevant past notes or code gists in <1s.
3. **Do-Next Radar:** Watches active Git branches, garden hardening schedule, and onboarding mocks; pings when idle >20 min with next highest-value task.
4. **Voice Drop:** Short mic-to-note capture using Whisper or MMS; auto-tagged into KM store.

### Next Steps

- **Setup Letta Environment:** Install Letta (e.g., Docker/Desktop) and `letta-client`.
- **Scaffold Letta Agents:** Create basic structures for Planner, Researcher, Memory, Critic, Executor agents within Letta.
- **Implement Core Memory Agent:** Focus on using Letta's memory features.
- **Define Letta Tools:** Start defining essential tools (shell, search).
- **Basic Agent Interaction:** Implement a simple 2-3 agent workflow on Letta.

## Current Status

- Core framework (Letta) selected.
- Documentation updated to reflect the Letta-based architecture.
- Ready to begin setting up the Letta environment and implementing the initial agent scaffolding.

## Known Issues/Limitations

- Implementation on the Letta platform has not yet begun.
- Specific integration details for existing concepts (like Reflexion) within Letta need to be determined.
- Previous code (OpenAI function calling loop, SQLite graph) needs adaptation or replacement within the Letta framework.
